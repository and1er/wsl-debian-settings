# wsl-debian-settings

Settings and package installations that I use for WSL Debian on Windows 10 update 2004 or higher to help myself to reproduce the environment in clear WSL Debian distro.

The scripts and commands should be run in WSL command line. To run WSL CLI there are a several ways:

* run `wsl` in `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe` terminals;
* run the distro's icon.

## Initial Setup of WSL

At now (Windows 10 Version 2004) firstly WSL should be installed, and after that the WSL -> WSL2 upgrage should be performed.

According to the official Microsoft guide: [Windows Subsystem for Linux Installation Guide for Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

    ```powershell
    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
    ```

    ```powershell
    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
    ```

2. Restart the PC.

    ```powershell
    Restart-Computer -Force
    ```

3. Install  the latest WSL2 Linux kernel from [Updating the WSL 2 Linux kernel](https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel).

4. Switch from WSL to WSL2:

    ```powershell
    wsl --set-default-version 2
    ```

5. Open the Microsoft Store, select and install a Linux distribution.

6. Run the distro for initial setup

    ```bash
    Installing, this may take a few minutes...
    Please create a default UNIX user account. The username does not need to match your Windows username.
    For more information visit: https://aka.ms/wslusers
    Enter new UNIX username: USERNAME
    New password:
    Retype new password:
    passwd: password updated successfully
    Installation successful!
    ```

7. Done!

## Distro Initial Setup

### Upgrading the distro

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
```

### Package installation

```bash
sudo apt install \
    man-db \
    man \
    vim \
    python3 \
    python3-pip \
    ssh-client \
    sshpass \
    curl \
    telnet \
    rsync \
    tree \
    wget \
    dnsutils \
    nfs-common \
    git
```

### Python pip packages installation

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade --user pip ansible paramiko
```

Making the user locally installed packages available in system `$PATH` (may be should be placed to `~/.profile` or `~/.bash_profile` (without `export` keyword) to be consistent):

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin/
```

### Generate SSH keys

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh \
    && ssh-keygen -t rsa -q -N '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

### Change prompt command color

The default color is green and it is the same as default color on Debian servers. To make the color different

```bash
vim ~/.bashrc
```

Ð°nd in block

```vim
if [ "$color_prompt" = yes ]; then
    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;33m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
else
    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$ '
fi
unset color_prompt force_color_prompt
```

the light-green color `01;32` was changed to light-yellow `01;33`.

### Ping without `sudo`

By default `/bin/ping` does not have `SUID` permissions bit:

```bash
$ ls -l /bin/ping
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 65272 Aug  3  2018 /bin/ping
```

and `ping` requires `sudo`. To avoid this run

```bash
sudo chmod +s /bin/ping
```

The result:

```bash
ls -l /bin/ping
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 65272 Aug  3  2018 /bin/ping
```

### Fix wrong DNS order when using VPN connection

I met this problem [DNS server coming from vpn network is not reflected in WSL #1350](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/1350): cannot resolve domain names from VPN connection via WSL because home ISP's DNS server has the first position in `/etc/resolv.conf`.
Also DNS search suffix is wrong.

I've removed following commented line and edited the file as I need.

```bash
$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
# This file was automatically generated by WSL. To stop automatic generation of this file, remove this line.
...
```

## Resetting the Distro

To revert the distro to the factory defaults: [Reset and Unregister WSL Linux Distro in Windows 10](https://winaero.com/blog/reset-unregister-wsl-linux-distro-windows-10/)

```bat
> wsl --list --all
Windows Subsystem for Linux Distributions:
Debian (Default)

> wsl --unregister Debian
Unregistering...

> wsl --list --all
Windows Subsystem for Linux has no installed distributions.
Distributions can be installed by visiting the Microsoft Store:
https://aka.ms/wslstore

> debian
Installing, this may take a few minutes...
Please create a default UNIX user account. The username does not need to match your Windows username.
For more information visit: https://aka.ms/wslusers
Enter new UNIX username: alosenkov
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully
Installation successful!
alosenkov@LOSENKOV-A:~$
```

The clear WSL distro is ready to work.

## TODO

* Local Ansible playbook to setup the WSL.
